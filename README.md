🛣️ Road Segmentation with U-Net

This project implements road segmentation using a U-Net deep learning architecture. The goal is to accurately identify and segment road regions from aerial or satellite images to support autonomous driving, road planning, and mapping applications.

🚀 Features

Implements U-Net architecture for pixel-level segmentation

Trained on aerial/satellite imagery dataset

Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

Visualizes segmentation masks vs ground truth results

Supports custom datasets for road extraction tasks

🧠 Technologies Used

Python, TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Results

High accuracy in detecting and segmenting road surfaces

Visual comparisons of predicted and actual segmentation masks
